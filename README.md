# Foodure

foodure is an application that deals with waste food management donation. Food waste has increased
dramatically. According to Food and Agriculture Organization, a third of all food produced for human
consumption is wasted globally, amounting to almost 1.3 billion tons each year. On the other hand,
according to the WHO, 20% of the population is affected by severe food shortages. As a result, a
solution that prevents food waste while still feeding the hungry is required.
